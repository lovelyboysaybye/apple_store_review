This app has warned me about things before they happen, this app has given me good news when I thought it was all over, I have benefited from Co-Star greatly and it has taught me so much about astrology and a lot about myself. I love the helpful insight that Co-Star has given me, it’s helped me navigate through so much. All I can say is scary accurate and on point. I wish I could give more than five stars, but to say the least I highly recommend this app, even if you have no clue about astrology or even if you are the biggest skeptic, give Co-Star a try for a few months and prepare to have your mind blown! ⭐️ Edit: June 29th 2025, I’m not vibing with the apps updated look rn.

And enjoyed that other screen that told you a bit more information including your strengths and weaknesses for the day. Weak weak move for the team to make. I will never pay for an app like this and it’s pathetic to push out users who have been enjoying these features for a very long time just to make more money… but that’s capitalism i guess Update jun 21: Just for all to know costar did go back to making the previous content they paywalled back to free. This is what the force of people banding together and not standing for a company being greedy does. Also I highly recommend using AstroMatrix!!! Much better app. Does have ads but has sooo much information",

(not that they were ever really public, but nontheless its disappointing.) the app DOES promise insights, but of course, its all hidden behind a paywall to bleed you dry. unless youre a long time user, you're essentially paying 50 bucks annually for an ai to tell you things.

        "text": "Hey, I’ve been using this app for about 3 years and it’s definitely been interesting to see what it’s predicted- but it can also be a little predictable. I feel like a lot of information is reused over and over, and even with a membership I still feel like I’m not really getting much but a blob of text. I like seeing my friends and stuff, but those horoscopes are the most redundant and I wish they’d be more in depth. Tell us when it’s good to hang out and what we should do etc. I feel like the membership should come with a lot more, whether that’s unlocking everything or what I’m not sure. It’s just lacking and I don’t see myself ever spending $50 for that.",

The crazy thing is all of those features used to be free! They have taken away sooooo much access on here to profit (and I get they’re a company) but maybe add NEW features instead of charging for the stuff that used to be free for everyone. The “dive deeper” option wasn’t a thing before, all that info was available front and center on the home page. Really disappointed.",

Their app says they’re behind on emails but I have sent three messages in the last two or so months and nothing. The different msg about purchasing the subscription was answered the same day.

If it were perhaps $2.99 (As most news/journalism apps) it would be completely reasonable given the features it provides, However, I can get much more in depth readings & quality from other ai service like grok (for example) who uses the same NASA data and much more sourced information minus the social element (which I didn’t really use anyway.) I appreciate what this app accomplished when it was free with half of the features, But now that another company decided to go down the same greed-driven subscription based model as the rest of the App Store. I’m going have to simply opt out. If the price point doesn’t bother you, I will say this is an adoring app that has many cute quirks & features (as well as it being aesthetically pleasing)… It’s simply a hard pass for me. Sorry Co-Star we had a good run — But this is just not the vibe in this current economy and I wish the best on your endeavors. If it went back to its previous iteration before this huge update recently, Atleast allowing half of the daily horoscope available (and the ability to use the widget without the subscription as previously functioned) maybe I’d come back. But $9?? Oof, No thank you.😒",

Today it was clear that AI was used because this was the “lesson”; “I apologize, but I cannot provide advice about illegally picking locks or trespassing, as that would be unethical and illegal. Perhaps we could explore legal ways to gain more freedom or expand your skills that don't involve breaking the law? I aim to give thoughtful perspectives while staying within ethical bounds.” Which is clearly an AI response they forgot to remove or clean up. I’ll be uninstalling and moving on to another app.",

However, my horoscopes are usually highly vague and disheartening. Very random, pretentious, nonsensical, and odd unnecessary callouts. I appreciate the poetic writing, but most of the time it just makes zero sense? For example, Today I had a great productive, confident day — yet this app told me I’d have “trouble” with each area of my life (including: routine, thinking & creativity, spirituality, social life, seggs and love, and self!) This happens often. The horoscope is almost never accurate. The only reason I keep redownloading it after deleting it is because of its cool aesthetics and ACTUALLY useful and accurate birth chart readings. So sadly, the paid features seem to be the best bet rather than the free ones. Not that great of a tool for casual astrologers.",

Literally, almost nothing additional besides a full calendar feature. My advice is to stay with the free version and avoid all the additional in app purchases to avoid disappointment and wasted money.",

Ive been exposed to so many different types of astrological programs and there are only a handful that are this accurate! There are so many parts of this app that I just love. The breakdown of each sign correlating with the various houses and planets. It is not just some vague blanketed “daily reading” of each sign but in depth readings of my daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly aspects of life. What makes this app even cooler is being able to invite your friends&family to join and then see the compatibility between you&them. I LOVE IT! March 2025 UPDATE: My first review is many years old before the newer & certainly the best features were added, as it was written when the app had only recently come out. BEFORE the app was available on Android. The personalized charts such as Your Relationship Analysis had been able to put into eloquent words what I had been feeling & seeing the patterns of myself for 20+ years without the ability to relay it to others. I love the “Do & Don’t” daily list & automatically given comparisons of friends current aspects in conjunction with your own. I only pay for a few apps monthly (YT, Apple Music, Human Design & THIS).",

While I get charging for services, buying the first tier (pro) gives you a tad more — but lacks much depth. Their prices don’t seem to match the value that other Astro apps bring to the table. I bought the pro for a month just to see what else I could access and got charged $19.99 somehow. Anybody else? Even if it was only $5.99 per month, it’s not worth it. There are better apps. Even free ones that offer more. I’m not usually one to leave a negative review but this one feels warranted.",

After being able to access this for years (since 2017), you can now see pretty much nothing unless you pay for the yearly subscription. I understand that a company needs to make money to function, but this is seriously disappointing. I will never pay $50 a year for this. If it was much more minimal (like $10), I might. But after having used it for so long, then going on one day to see it has changed so much, I am seriously disappointed. No thank you. Goodbye. 👎🏻",

Co-Star to me has always been insanely accurate with EVERYTHING. For me it’s become a routine to check it in the morning to know how my day with go, and it usually happens just like in a way. There have been times where I’ve used it as a guide to help me throughout my day, week, etc. It’s always been a good anchor to know things will get better. Co-Star has also helped me understand my emotions and how my mind works through astrology, and you can get everything you need without paying for anything (even though I do wish I could pay for some of the stuff on there) All in all it’s a really good app and I recommend!! It’s very accurate and reliable :))",

Intellectually, I tend to be more science based which this team totally is . Otherwise, it would just be fluff.. What I also love about this app. The most is they do not bother you. They do not make you watch pop-up ads. You can pay for more in depth information. But it’s not like all those annoying subscriptions or charging you for anything they tell you it’s not like that. It’s total class. I have been with them now for a few years and You know you’ve probably met people or been friends with people that do everything based on their astrology or birth. I’m very interested in that, but I don’t make decisions in my life based on that yet they give me so much positive feedback and information to guide me on a daily basis if I so choose that they’ve really expanded my knowledge on astrology. I highly recommend that you Give it a try and yes once a year the issue your coming year of highlights and it’s so reasonably priced it’s well worth it other than that they are professional professionals and there’s a big difference. It’s sort of like the weather only in the sense that I only use Storm Radar App for my weather. I really appreciate respect all of the broadcasters that are meteorologist and on the news every morning they’re very professional. And capable, but I travel a lot so I can go up on my radar app and I can get everything that actually is happening on radar. Well this is what this team is like they are the radar of your birth sign. I highly recommend. Thank you for your time.",

I’ve used this app for years now and i just went to check my daily updates and now you have to pay to see information you could see for free for years. It’s a shame because i used this app every day but im not about to spend money on something i’ve used for free for years now. This honestly really disappointed me because like i said this was mine and a lot of people’s favorite astrology app but i notice now everyone is starting to switch to different apps. Sad start to 2025.",

Even after purchasing a report, the content remains underwhelming, prioritizing pitfalls over constructive advice. Co-Star seems designed more to provoke reflection than to support personal growth, leaving users with little actionable direction beyond its critiques.",

        "text": "As many of the reviews stated I did love the clean and chic design of the app but the functions that it offers I found were extremely limited. The only promising area called the “void” where you can ask any questions and get answers according to your chart felt shallow and unethically deterministic as if the answers were given by the most crude astrology AI that only looks at the planet positions at surface levels which is not how real astrology should be practiced. It’s doubly insulting that the app will make you pay for those empty answers devoid of depth and humanity which felt exploitive. Daily horoscope also felt equal parts deterministic and vague at the same time if that’s even possible probably because it was generated by the same crude AI. In my opinion chatGPT does a way better job at interpreting natal charts more in depth especially if you know a little bit about astrology. One good thing about this app is that it will allow you to add your friends’ charts if you want to gain more insight into your friends and family’s lives so I give 2 stars for that but I personally wouldn’t waste my time with this app and deleted it promptly.",

For a free app, it sure does give a lot of great info. I've been on here for years and love it. That's why I chose, on my own free time to rate this app 5 stars ✨⭐️⭐️🌟⭐️⭐️✨ because I truly feel it deserves it. I hope it never changes, and I love the notifications that are usually SPOT ON btw, telling me what to expect for the day. Thank you co-Star for being the co-pilot on my journey into astrology. Forever grateful for this app. I don't even have to look up what my big 3 are anymore thanks to costar! I'm a gemini sun ♊️ , gemini moon ♊️ , and Sagittarius rising ♐️.

I hadn’t known how much I needed this moment of reflection and self-care, but it felt like a missing piece of the puzzle fell into place.

        "text": "Used Co — Star since 2020. I find it comical how this app was just free and all of a sudden we need “Pro — Star” to see anything on the app. It was always very transparent and accurate. Everything in the app was helpful as well as informative. Now, unless you subscribe you get basically no information or guidance. You get one sentence and a riddled one-word list of do’s and don’t’s. That’s it besides the weather and the option to write yourself a future message that you may never see again. I’d suggest to give us access to the guide for Today, at the very least. This update causes me to not see any reason to keep the app at this point. $8/mo. is a controversially expensive price in my opinion. There’s not even a free trial. It was good while it lasted though.",

I’ve paid for two “your year ahead” report and was really disappointed by the second report. It’s nearly identical to my previous year. It’s like they didn’t even try but I blame that on lazy AI. If I wanted AI to make a report for me I would just use ChatGPT. I reached out to the support team to let them know this but their response was basically “too bad so sad” and that there are transits that lasts years and themes that repeat. Ok I get that. But can you at least have the AI create something more original, meaningful, and not a copy paste. It wasn’t worth the money at all. They offered me credits for their other AI future teller nonsense but I didn’t take them up on that.",

I’m not okay with uncomfortable silences for one. If it is uncomfortable then inheritantly that means people are not feeling okay and if you’re okay then it isn’t uncomfortable. Co-star you clearly appeal to a less intelligent crowd. Horoscopes are vague like every other astrology source. I’m sure they will just move the goal posts if they respond to me, but it is clear they are trying to hoodwink the below average thinker, or do they believe their own nonsense. Perhaps the latter because the designers are not smart enough to understand that uncomfortable silences aren’t uncomfortable if someone feels “okay with it”. Astrology is vague nonsense and I worry for those saying it is “scarily accurate”, they are ripe to be a victim of a Ponzi scheme.",

All of that astrology jazz seemed fake. Then I found out about Co-Star and honestly- I have checked it pretty much every day for a year and don’t plan on stopping. Co-Star does astrology on a totally different way. I use it mostly for comparability- this app predicts my partner’s daily mood in such an on point way it’s down to the type of food they want or like if they just need some alone time. The paying extra part is too expensive imo considering in one year I have had a couple of repeats (maybe that’s just my life lol idk how this works really). The relationship part is just so hard to look past- I added some random person I knew for 5 seconds awhile ago and I really wish she didn’t move like the next day cause sounds like we’d be best friends lol! There’s a daily dos and donts list which I chuckle at cause usually I check this app later in the day and it’ll have things I 100% did or plan to do later on there- lots of oddly specific things like “do: extra cheese” and “don’t: ex’s instagram”. I just love the writers- they make me chuckle every day :) I totally recommend this app! Downfall- very expensive in app purchases for things that AI can tell us about nowadays.",

        "text": "Co—Star is decent for learning the basics of astrology and minimal understanding of your’s and others’ chart placements, but the daily horoscopes are terrible. The whimsical nonsense on the app is useless—I'm not going to get embroidered robes of my deepest insecurities with anyone, let alone an acquaintance. I couldn't care less about what my three random friends would do in a haunted house. It’s also very recycled, says the same fanciful nonsense for every person. *Do not expect to comprehend what the planets or houses actually represent from this app. It has a very “astrology for dummies” approach* The app needs more depth and less fluff. The \"day at a glance\" section is always dumb and completely irrelevant to life. No, I'm not going to do some weirdly specific thing like underwater basket weaving. It's just too whimsical for me. Before I found other apps, Co—Star was helpful for learning about placements. I even paid for a relationship report, but I never received it. Despite reaching out to them, I still never got it. The first relationship report I got was good, but the second one I paid for never arrived. Overall, this app isn’t good if you’re looking for serious astrology. It's more for entertainment and is laughable among true astrology enthusiasts.",

Anyone who actually understands astrology laughs at people who use this app. It’s really, really bad. I have a friend with a chart that’s nearly identical to mine, and when we read what the app said about each other it was just…weird. Like it told me that he was prone to jealousy and I was more open-hearted, but then it told him the exact same thing about me being jealous and him being open-hearted. There were numerous instances like that. Stay away from this app. I would have recommended The Pattern but they just ruined their app with the new update. Lots of people are complaining though, so hopefully they change it back. Their info is way more in depth and accurate.",

        "text": "In my quest for celestial insights, I turned to Co-Star, an app that promised a tailored astrological experience. Unfortunately, my journey through the stars with Co-Star has been anything but personalized. Day after day, I am presented with readings that echo yesterday's words—a monotonous repetition that offers no new wisdom or reflection. The app's insistence on highlighting non-existent spiritual troubles is particularly baffling. It claims I'm at odds with my spirituality, yet I stand firm and content on my spiritual path. This repetitive narrative not only undermines the app's credibility but also my trust in its ability to provide unique and insightful guidance. The beauty of astrology lies in its personal touch, the nuanced readings that resonate on a deeper level. Co-Star, however, seems to have missed the mark, delivering a generic experience that could apply to anyone. To the developers of Co-Star, I urge you to consider the individuality of your users. We seek connections with the cosmos that reflect our personal journeys, not a one-size-fits-all approach that leaves us questioning the app's understanding of the stars. In conclusion, Co-Star has been a letdown. It has failed to live up to its promise of personalization and has instead left me with a sense of disconnection from the celestial guidance I sought. One can only hope that future updates will bring about the change needed to make Co-Star a truly stellar companion.",

Most of the info is free and the only parts that cost you money are if you choose to find even more information that is very valuable & in-depth. This app also doesn’t nag at you with various texts, emails or notifications. I constantly keep my notifications off bc I don’t like to be disturbed for small inconvenient things, I don’t have to even worry about that with the app. I suggest this to literally everyone I know, tell them to give it a chance even if they’re not that interested in horoscopes.

That’s just not cool, it’s marketed as a free app and while the general stuff is still free majority of specifics or future predictions aren’t anymore, that’s like the main reason i got it in the first place. I was even debating giving it 2 stars because they just seem money hungry at this point so i’m deleting the app after having it for over 3 years. I still gave it 3 because it does give you a nice set up for your chart and nice daily updates as well as little notes about friends. I really hope they go back to their previous business model in the future but i doubt it.",

        "text": "Most of the content on this app (over the last year) has been impressively accurate, detailed and insightful in a very personalized way.. I’ve noticed a more “serious” approach in the style of the writing that makes it easier to understand for those of us who may struggle with abstract concepts in the absence of visual or audio stimuli. The interaction between the more complex aspects of a person’s full chart, are what make this type of “reading”or access to astrology based information a huge asset to any individual! So many people who think astrology is “ generic”, or “fake” would likely be shocked at how personal it gets when you look at the whole chart and have guidance or guidelines for how to interpret it and apply it to your life. This app offers both chart and table placements as visual aids, has accurate and consistently updated personalized astrology based information in relation to current planetary alignments, and where they were compared to the exact day and time of your birth. Furthermore, if you invest in the paid content, the value of the insights are unexpectedly deeply personal and so insightful and on point..",

Sure some astrology stuff is very vague and made to be a fun novelty and non serious thing. I would urge those who have not taken a dive into the history of astronomy astrology and numerology- to do so. And also, get this app. I wish they didnt start charging a bit much for the extra features. However, I still use this daily and my god….its spot on.",

I know some people think they’re random, but as someone who’s studied astrology I enjoyed them as ways of embodying energies of a transit and figuring out if they were meant to enhance or mitigate that energy (like, for instance, taking a cold shower during a difficult Mars transit), and found it really grounding and inspiring as a daily/weekly practice. Now it isn’t clear what transit the dos and don’ts are referring to, and it’s laborious for me to comb through the entire daily update (which is often repetitive and confusing) to figure it out. Could that element of the previous format be reinstated? It makes for a cleaner and more actionable experience of the app.",

Not saying that it hasn’t been accurate or some of the things it has said been weird, but overall a good app. Sometimes I’ve gotta look up words or phrases lol.

Some of the horoscopes of this app use the the other 3 planets, which is very annoying, as I have to detach them from the transits that I utilize. Overall, it’s a good astrology app!",

All you can do now is just read whatever vague description they write for you. I really miss when there was a social aspect to the app since I bet people don’t have many friends who are into astrology. The clubs just gave me and others a way to connect and get meaning off of questions we may have. Plus with the new “void” thing the whole app just kinda seems like it’s leaning into subscription-based service territory. If that happens I’m definitely deleting the app. I would really like to see a comeback of the clubs or just really any social aspect in general, then maybe my review would reach 4 stars.",

Even so it's pretty much spot on with predictions and information. So if it's something that you take seriously, then i'm sure you'll love this app too! Maybe it's just the coincidence, or maybe it's just in tune with folks who take it seriously, but either way it's the most helpful, informative, and accurate app i have found, and i've tried dozens of them.

        "text": "I’m gonna be completely honest, I totally enjoy this app and all the extremely interesting information it provides to each individual sign. It definitely different then most typical Astrological apps out there! The only thing that’s a bit disappointing is the fact that it won’t allow you to see a lot of the information unless u pay. And it won’t allow more then 3 or 4 questions in the “Void” section. It would be a lot nicer if we could at least receive more credits by watching adds playing a game. That would be a great feature to add. Cuz at this moment it’s a bit of a downer when u only asked 3 questions and then realize u have to a pay for more. Also a at least a 3 day free trial would’ve been really cool to kind of get a better understanding on how much does it really have to offer. And I personally think that adding animations and sounds to each sigh its own unique style would make it a lot more easy and pleasing on the eyes. Otherwise its a great app! 👍😊❤️",

I relate more heavily to my Pisces sign when it comes to emotions and attachment. There should be a reading for those with cusp signs to show that their personality could lean more to their other sign. I’m glad that we shared with each other because the reading that it gave on me made me sound like a walking red flag. It didn’t match me at all which is scary because if people are truly basing their decisions on whether or not to pursue their romantic interest or to keep someone in their life for whatever reason, then this could kill people’s relationships. I do believe that proper natal charts are worth it and this one did okay with some other areas of the app but it definitely gave me and a few other people that I have talked to a bad taste when it comes to the romantic/compatibility area so I don’t recommend it for that. I would go with ‘The Pattern’. I feel like this one is way more accurate. Otherwise the rest of the app is pretty decent",

I’ve been on different apps that didn’t even get that right. There is much useful information on this app. I feel it’s as accurate as it gets in this realm I’ve always been a bit skeptical of, as well as any realm or religious belief. Oh and sharing with friends is a big plus for me. Turns out my first girlfriend is the one that got away. We never have a frowny face. Always a smiley face on love and pleasure. Lol. This app navigates easily. Have fun.",

And if that’s what you’re looking for, this is it. Though the astrology is pretty good for an ap, it is heavy on words and design but not so heavy on astrology. Even though they do a good job of speaking with confidence around their delineations they aren’t always accurate or complete.",

This app helps me in seeing, and accepting the things I don’t want to face. If you do not try this app you are truly robbing yourself of the powers we hold inside of our brains and our connection to the solar system in relation to the exact time and day we took our first breath and showing us that screenshot of where the planets were aligned in very moment of the first breath. Don’t over think it, just try it.",

Truly a must-have for anyone who is interested in learning more about their star-and-planet-self. It does your whole birth chart if you know when and where you were born. I've gained so much useful, unfathomable insight. Not to mention all the cool extra features, like writing notes to your future self and relationship readings, just to name a couple. Get this app whether you're a novice star-reader or an advanced astrologer!",

But suddenly the last couple months everything has changed and become extremely negative. Basically, the app keeps trying to make me and my gf break up!! 😡 Every day it insists that we constantly fight and argue and don't like each other which is not true!! It was kinda funny the first couple times but after months she’s now legit wondering if our relationship is actually doomed, she just texted me she wants to spend some time apart to think things over. This app ruins relationships and lives, STAY AWAY!!",

My love for this app has reversed and turned to hate (I am, personally, only capable of hating something that I once loved). I stuck it out with the app hoping that problems I was experiencing with the app would change for the better overtime, but alas they only got worse, not better. First it was the condescending and judgmental descriptions used to interpret the stars. Then I dealt with being cyber stalked through the app. And over time the daily messages became more and more vicious and judgmental. You might have my tropical astrology natal chart information, Co-Star. However, you will never know or understand me.",

No wonder co-star has a crisis text line linked in their app. After closing a horrible reading with “It’s as if you confuse self sacrifice for survival”…..uh it’s as if costar is aware of the crap their AI bots are spewing out into the world and are too lazy to do anything about it. If the crisis text line was there because they were concerned about people’s well being they wouldnt let their AI bots use medical terms like it’s edgy mad libs.

It’s funny because I had to google if I was the only one and I’m not lol literally just google it. There’s way too many threads about this same issue I’m explaining. Cute concept. Great graphic but I don’t think a professional works there at all (app development). Great for checking your chart though. But you can do that anywhere. Like I said the concept is great. The app is very nice to the eye. But it’s harsh and not truly personalized. My friends laugh because we all get the same things on different days. We lost trust in this app. For someone new to astrology they might love this app but not for very long. Just be careful. Love and light to you all 💚",

The app accused me of “lying” to sound interesting. As someone with panic disorder, who had a panic attack yesterday I don’t need an application I look to for insight trolling me. Last night I had a panic attack after talking to my aging father about his health only to wake up to this application insulting me, I’m deleting it, and I will never come back.

I don’t understand why the developers would even consider 🤯removing the platform for social networking. As we are humans and it’s in our nature to be socially in person and now as technology develops on platforms such as these. I would hope reconsideration of bringing back the platform to have everyone engaging again would be great!",

If it’s supposed to be NASA driven science or whatever, why is the weather in my location wrong everyday - by a lot. Ie: yesterday Co-Star said it was 70 deg when in certainly wasn’t it was actually 56 according to weather.com. I don’t know anymore I think it had a good run but no longer believable for me.",

Sometimes I’ll see some wonderful astrological aspects and the AI writes something so…pessimistic. Why? Also the AI writes some repetitive sentences that make me lose track of what aspect I’m looking at. So the distinction between the tone gets lost in the sauce.

I’d seen Co-star before and I knew it was notorious for being pretty quirky with their readings which is why I picked it over other apps, It had nice graphics and starting out it was pretty legit! I used it for a long time, got my friends and family to use it, not noticing how slowly my horoscopes were becoming more and more grim as time went on. Eventually I wanted to pay for the in depth love reading because, being single and happy, I thought it would be super lighthearted and fun. I was wrong :D. “No matter what you’ve told yourself, you are not a victim.” Are you kidding me? Literally quoting part of what that overly-negative, borderline hateful horoscope read. I really hope other people who got the same reading I did didn’t read into it at all because if I didn’t know any better it would have made me really upset. In my personal experience, I don’t think it’s normal for readings to come off as negative as this app approaches it, it’s unnecessarily harsh. Don’t buy into it, don’t download it, it’s not worth the negativity.",

I like the daily horoscopes as well and notifications it pushes each day. Honestly all the other features I don’t pay much attention to, everything else feels like fluff that’s used to just added to the app that’s not really needed. I paid for the relationship stuff with my partner and while it was fun for a week or two we didn’t get any closer than a blunt and journaling couldn’t have done. I do like how they implemented the new AI chat bot but it’s a little gimmicky and cash grabby. I’d rather do tarot or something because knowing it’s just rebranded AI doesn’t feel authentic. But the core concept of the app and the chart, explanations, and horoscopes each day are hard to beat and are what brings me back each day. I’m sure there’s more advanced stuff out there that’ll dive into the more nuances of your chart like planet positions and nodes but this app gives exactly what you *need* in an easily consumable package that’s perfect for beginners.",

But my favorite thing about it is you can see your friends charts too. And not only that but how you’re compatible as (or not) too! It’s not accurate eeevery time imo but more times than not, I’m feeling very seen or called out depending on the message. I like astrology and had always wanted to figure out how to chart my own but this makes it simple to understand for beginners. And those like me who want the knowledge but have to be on the go. They add new things from time to time so it’s never boring. Get to know yourself better with Co-Star!!!",

That’s the question, but for me, it’s entertaining, interesting and insightful in ways that make me want to understand traits of who I am with the insight I get from the app. I take what resonates and feels right and altogether, I still don’t know how to “meditate”, but the daily messages definitely marinate in my mind and I like to think about those messages as a little tool from the universe that for some reason, it wants me to know because otherwise, I’d probably miss that special message or “seed” that’ll germinate at its due time. So all in all, really cool app, I’m happy to have encountered it and it’s something I look forward to daily. *Note* sometimes, messages feel like they’ve been told many times before, just worded differently in some instances, but either way, it’s good enough variation and “repetition” of interesting content that makes me feel good.

(another thing, if anyone actually reads this, which probably won’t happen, but why is everything black and white? it’s cool and all, but why is it like that?’",

This app triggered anxiety with the daily notifications as it manifests garbage in this horrible, hateful disgusting app. The content is creepy (bad creepy) as ever and it eggs you on to put yourself in this crippling negative light by constantly grossly exaggerating and affirming traits that you may need to work on. It feeds on negativity and self doubt. I do not know why this app is so popular.",

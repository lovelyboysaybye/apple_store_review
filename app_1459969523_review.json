It has been almost impossible to get in touch with customer service and after a while, the chat, but just stop responding to you. Subscriber beware for me it certainly wasn‚Äôt worth it and I‚Äôm still regretting my decision to do so today.",

I paid for their reading BAIT which turned out to be generic one that can be found everywhere free on internet - and it followed with TWO ADDITIONAL CHARGES in a total of $90 I didn‚Äôt not sign up for and didn‚Äôt know where they put the sneaky information at. So I requested refund right after seeing it in my bank statement. But it‚Äôs been a month now and there is still no response other than a template email stating they have a high volume of requests ( I wonder why) and may not be able to respond right away. But it‚Äôs been a MONTH. When I tried to unsubscribe which is usually straightforward- yet they also made it inconvenient as shown below Which double confirms on their shady intention. I call for people stop using shady business like this that offers no integrity, only to BAIT money into their service - ESPECIALLY IN THE NAME OF SPIRITUALITY. ‚Äî‚Äî Here is a guide how to cancel your web subscription: Log in to your account on AskNebula.com using your credentials or by completing the quiz.

It‚Äôs awful. Then your like well I already paid for those min it so I guess I should not waste it and use them it‚Äôs just a vicious cycle keep going not to just take it with out asking especially with someone who has never done stuff like this it‚Äôs confusing I really liked the psychic, she was great but I actually regret getting on here because I cannot afford how much money I spent if I would‚Äôve known I was gonna spend almost 300$ or maybe more With the other stuff like the 50$ package deal and a bunch of 9 $ here and there I'm a single mother, I have no help I have no family. Every thing is on so I‚Äôm honestly a little upset I know it‚Äôs my fault to I should‚Äôve looked into it better I didn‚Äôt realize every single thing every little button you push is money coming out when I thought I already paid for it that‚Äôs why I was confused. I would‚Äôve never got this this so so-called package deal lol for 50$ I thought that covered everything. But It‚Äôs not every little continue or yes is more money, I don‚Äôt know I feel like it‚Äôs Money making trap and pray on people who are in pain and feel desperate",

But as soon as I did, I guess the previous unseen chats were made visible (even though I could and have already read them) they charged my account for it. So I got exactly one sentence out and that was it. They charge $3.99/min and UP for these psychics to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù and ‚Äú connecting to your energy‚Äù all the while taking up minutes that you have paid for. A real intuitive, or empath, or ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù as they call themselves, wouldn‚Äôt need to ask. Speaking as an empath myself, if you are legit, you just know. Either you get a feeling, or your guides give you images to discern from. Yes, they can give you basic info or tell you your horoscope, but you can do that yourself with a deck of tarot cards This app is taking advantage of people who are honestly curious about their lives and taking advantage of their wallets. If you‚Äôre going to pay money, find someone who can see you in person or someone with a good reputation. You might have to wait and pay more, but at least you‚Äôll be getting someone real. Not saying all the psychics on here aren‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs just too easy to waste minutes on basic info. That‚Äôs where they get you. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Much love and light to all of you. I hope you find what you are looking for and I hope that God blesses you with the answers you seek. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",

I am convinced this is some kind of scheme intentionally designed to cheat people and then hide from any kind of retribution for their near (if not full blown) criminal actions. Their actual app is a joke. Vague niceties that could blend in with hallmark poetry, but draped in a celestial purple-soaked, \"witchy\" aesthetic.

        "text": "Late last Monday night I took a test on Instagram that lead me to nebula. I went to sleep and the following morning I got a charge in to my empty bank account stating that I was hit for 69.95 the exact total of a years membership. I immediately called my branch I need to find out I have to dispute it with The merchant themselves. I then went to the App Store into the Nebula support net work and put in a request for a refund. I did not intend on purchasing a subscription.Shortly there after I received an email denying my refund. Now about a week later, I am beginning to get dinged for $19.95 on my cash app cardThat I never provided nebula to be able to even charge in the first place. I believe this is a confluence of data brokers in a predatory billing practice reaching right into my pockets and taking money. Don‚Äôt get me wrong nebula astrology is amazing. They use her in her face is fantastic. They give you lots of information and I was like I quite like the app but I was hoodwinked and blindsided. Don‚Äôt download unless you actually have the money to pay for itüëéüèª",

Although they were skilled readers I‚Äôve never been one who resonated with putting a price on helping people. Now the astrology section although somewhat correct-looked off and outdated. The kind of astrology that‚Äôs good for people new to natal chart but not for those of us who are familiar with varieties of charts,asteroids,placements and aspects let alone a more accurate reflection of position utilized on some websites like Astrodienst. Tbh I don‚Äôt even bother with the palm reading. Mostly bc I was taught that a palm reading much like other readings begin when a person walks in the door. Overall a cool introductory app for people but not alot of new knowledge for people who have been around. The whole starseed thing is interesting but on the grand scheme of things awareness comes with walking in integrity and purpose. I just so happen to help people confront their own selfish delusions and step into practicing consideration and empathy.",

I now have $80.01 on the app and it won‚Äôt allow me to refund it, due to it ‚Äúnot being a subscription through Apple‚Äù. So now I have to get a whole new bank card tomorrow and change all of my bills to a new card, just so it‚Äôll stop charging me 39.99 A MONTH!",

        "text": "I was offered a 7 day free trial and I gave it a shot. Before the 7 day trial was completed, I went on my computer to log in and cancel the subscription before being charged $45.00. Or so I thought. Next thing I see on my bank statement is a $45.00 charge after I knowingly (have the screenshots) that my membership was cancelled and that I won‚Äôt be charged. Again, I thought I canceled on time before the free 7 day trial ended. Next thing I did was go through a few times with the nebula support chat, which was a bot. It took ‚Äúnote‚Äù of my request for a refund and that I provide the needed information for a live agent to correspond with me through the email I have provided. All I got from this supposed service was a transcript of what the bot and I were chatting about. No live agent/human. No before, the so called nebula commenters say, ‚Äúoh, we‚Äôre so sorry to hear about your unsatisfactory experience - here‚Äôs our support email‚Äù - well let me stop you right there! I hav tried one more time to send an actual email than go through the ridiculous bot chat and provided the same information asked for the refund to get processed. Overall, unless this I receive my full $45.00 refund, this app and the customer service support has put a sour taste. Anyone looking to use this and don‚Äôt mind subscribing- go for it. But to cancel and make sure that you have a great customer service-NOT corresponding with a AI chat bot- I strongly recommend that you don‚Äôt use this app at all.",

There‚Äôs probably a three or four word difference in the same sentence of a paragraph as if the writer is in middle school and is ‚Äúnot plagiarizing‚Äù their essay. Also, the friend I added is a Scorpio-Libra cusp. She‚Äôs a Scorpio, but the app said her chart landed her in Libra, and the horoscope connected to her profile is the exact same as mine which is Scorpio. It also has Scorpio and Libra intertwined with each other when viewing planetary placements which is annoying.

I understand the app developers need to make money for the work they do, but the lack of things you can do on the app now is seriously disappointing. You cannot view your birth chart or insights anymore now without a subscription. I am about to delete the app because it is basically useless to me now.

When I redownloaded the app and logged in to use the sub I never wanted I no longer have it‚Ä¶. Same login info. I have been working with support for literally weeks (a month+) trying to get this resolved and get my premium access restored with no success. So now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm out $50 with no access to my service that I paid for. Service is polite but seems like they can‚Äôt actually get it resolved.

You said one dollar for the REPORT and on my own I assumed there would be a subscription when I looked for one to cancel it it was not one to be found as previously stated the app did not show that a sub subscription was activated in the App Store when I went to make sure I wasn‚Äôt signed up for anything because the app is deceiving from the ads that are created for it.

I didn‚Äôt need to tell her anything about myself except my date of birth and she was able to answer my questions with just that. I will need to have a few more readings to give a more informed opinion on this site, but so far I‚Äôm impressed. It is a little spendy , but if I get the answers I need, it will be worth it. I have had other readings with other online psychics and have felt like they were intentionally taking their time with their replies since you are charged by the minute . But so far I am pleased with the service. I will definitely use them again. Thank you",
